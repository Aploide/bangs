 # Bangs for Eyed Search

Welcome to "Bangs for Eyed Search" - a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance your web navigation by providing quick and efficient search shortcuts known as "bang" commands. These bang shortcuts allow you to perform searches directly from the address bar of your browser, making it faster and more convenient than ever to find what you're looking for online.

## How Bang Shortcuts Work

A bang shortcut is a URL that starts with an exclamation mark (`!`). When entered in the address bar of most search engines, it triggers a specific search query. For example:
- Typing `!g hello` will open Google and perform a search for "hello".
- Typing `!d who invented the internet` will direct you to DuckDuckGo to search for information on who invented the internet.

## Available Bang Shortcuts

The repository contains predefined bang shortcuts in JSON format, stored in two files:
1. **bangs.json**: Contains the full set of bang shortcuts including comments and formatting for easy readability.
2. **bangs.minified.json**: A minified version of `bangs.json` without comments or unnecessary whitespace, optimized for faster processing.

Make sure your shortcut starts with an exclamation mark (`!`) followed by a unique identifier and the URL pattern which includes `{{{query}}}` where the search term should be inserted.

## Example Contribution

If you want to add a shortcut that searches YouTube for tutorials on "JavaScript basics", your entry might look like this:

```json
{
    "bangshortcut": "JavaScript tutorials",
    "!yt": "https://www.youtube.com/results?q={{{query}}}"
}
```

After adding this to `bangs.json` and running the minification script, it should also appear in `bangs.minified.json`.

## Scripts for Minification

You can use a Bash script located at `/path/to/your/minfier.sh bangs.json` to generate `bangs.minified.json`. Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x minifier.sh`).
